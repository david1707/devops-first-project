## 1. Run a Docker container with Jenkins

You can run Jenkins in your host, Virtual Machine, Docker container, etc. But the best option is to run a Docker Container from docker-compose.yml so Docker may create a container for you with everything we need. Run it with

`docker-compose up -d`

Stop the container:
`docker-compose stop`

Start the container:
`docker-compose stop`

Check if the container is alive
`docker ps`
